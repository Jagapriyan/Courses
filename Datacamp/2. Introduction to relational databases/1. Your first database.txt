Relational Database

Database
A database models real-life entities like professors and universities by storing them in tables. i.e real-life entities become tables
Each table only contains data from a single entity type. which reduces redundancy. For example, there should only one row of data containing the details of a certain company. 
A datbase can be used to model relationships between entities. eg: a professor(table) can work at multiple universities(table) and companies(table). 
We can define how entities relate to each other. 

Information Schema database

SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables;

Information_schema database is available in PostgreSQL by default. It is also available in MySQL, SQL server. 
It is actually some sort of meta-database that holds information about your current database. 

information_schema has multiple tables you can query with the known SELECT * FROM syntax:

tables: information about all tables in your current database
columns: information about all columns in all of the tables in your current database

In this exercise, you'll only need information from the 'public' schema, which is specified as the column table_schema of the tables and columns tables. 
The 'public' schema holds information about user-defined tables and databases. 
The other types of table_schema hold system information – for this course, you're only interested in user-defined stuff.

Challenge 1:

Get information on all table names in the current database, while limiting your query to the 'public' table_schema.

-- Query the right table in information_schema
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables
-- Specify the correct table_schema value
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

Challenge2: 

Now have a look at the columns in university_professors by selecting all entries in information_schema.columns that correspond to that table.

-- Query the right table in information_schema to get columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'university_professors' AND table_schema = 'public';

Challenge3

Finally, print the first five rows of the university_professors table.

-- Query the first five rows of our table
SELECT * FROM university_professors
LIMIT 5;

Tables

Working examples in DVDrental DB

SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;


SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';



Columns

SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'film';
