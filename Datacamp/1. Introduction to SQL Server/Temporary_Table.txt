Imagine we have written a query, joning information from different tables, with nicely aliased column names. 
It would be great if this was a table that we could use for further work.
In this case, we can create a temporary table and once we have created it, it's available for further querying for the remainder of our session.
The temporary table will exist until either our connection or session ends or we manually remove with 'DROP TABLE' statement. 

We write our SELECT query, but in between SELECT and FROM, we use the keyword INTO, and then type our desired table name, prefaced by the hash(#) sign.



SELECT
col1,
col2,
col3 INTO #my_temp_table
FROM my_existing_table
WHERE
-- conditions
